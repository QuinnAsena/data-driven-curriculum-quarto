# Neotoma Explorer 


## Lab overview

This lab is designed to introduce you to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database and Neotoma Explorer. Neotoma DB is an open and community-curated resource for paleoecological data. Open means that anyone can find and download data from Neotoma. Community-curated means that Neotoma data are augmented and maintained by a community of experts, with many scientists contributing their data to Neotoma and actively working to curate and improve these data. Explorer is a graphical interface that is very handy for a first-pass search, discovery, and viewing of paleoecological data, typically exploring a few sites at a time. In following weeks, we will move to more advanced visualizations and analyses of paleoecological data, using software designed to download data from Neotoma and analyze it.
