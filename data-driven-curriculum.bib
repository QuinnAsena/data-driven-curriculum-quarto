  abstract = {We consider the problem of reconstructing prehistoric climates by using fossil data that have been extracted from lake sediment cores. Such reconstructions promise to provide one of the few ways to validate modern models of climate change. A hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach is presented and its use, inversely, is demonstrated in a relatively small but statistically challenging exercise: the reconstruction of prehistoric climate at Glendalough in Ireland from fossil pollen. This computationally intensive method extends current approaches by explicitly modelling uncertainty and reconstructing entire climate histories. The statistical issues that are raised relate to the use of compositional data (pollen) with covariates (climate) which are available at many modern sites but are missing for the fossil data. The compositional data arise as mixtures and the missing covariates have a temporal structure. Novel aspects of the analysis include a spatial process model for compositional data, local modelling of lattice data, the use, as a prior, of a random walk with long-tailed increments, a two-stage implementation of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and a fast approximate procedure for cross-validation in inverse problems. We present some details, contrasting its reconstructions with those which have been generated by a method in use in the palaeoclimatology literature. We suggest that the method provides a basis for resolving important challenging issues in palaeoclimate research. We draw attention to several challenging statistical issues that need to be overcome.},

Using a global set of {$>$}1100 fossil pollen records, Mottl               et al.               explored the rates of vegetation change over the past 18,000 years (see the Perspective by Overpeck and Breshears). The authors show that the rates of change accelerated markedly during the Late Holocene ({$\sim$}4.6 to 2.9 thousand years ago), even more rapidly than the climate-driven vegetation changes associated with the end of the last glacial period. In addition, the Late Holocene acceleration began for terrestrial communities as a whole, suggesting that the acceleration in turnover over the past two centuries is the tip of a deeper trend.

Using a compilation of 1181 fossil pollen sequences and newly developed statistical methods, we detect a worldwide acceleration in the rates of vegetation compositional change beginning between 4.6 and 2.9 thousand years ago that is globally unprecedented over the past 18,000 years in both magnitude and extent. Late Holocene rates of change equal or exceed the deglacial rates for all continents, which suggests that the scale of human effects on terrestrial ecosystems exceeds even the climate-driven transformations of the last deglaciation. The acceleration of biodiversity change demonstrated in ecological datasets from the past century began millennia ago.},

Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international               14               C calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable               14               C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the               14               C ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine               14               C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals.},

  abstract = {A radiocarbon-dated pollen diagram from a typical lowland raised bog in County Antrim is presented, together with a limited stratigraphic study. The record of vegetational development described is unusually complete for the last 12 500 years. The pollen diagram is divided into ten pollen zones which it is hoped will be useful to the non-specialist. A visual summary is given in Figure 5. Deposits of the Midlandian late-glacial are contained in a small basin beneath the reedswamp and later Sphagnum peats of the mire. Birch woodland developed early in the sequence (approx. 12 350 BP) in the Bolling interstadial period. Declines of this woodland occurred at approx. 12 200 BP and 11 700 BP. The probability that the 12 200 BP decline represents the end of the thermal maximum of the late-glacial interstadial is discussed. In the period equivalent to the classical Allerod interstadial, the vegetation appears to have been essentially treeless. A summary comparison of Irish Late-glacial pollen assemblage zones is given. All radiocarbon dates are conventional, without calibration. The birch woods of the early post-glacial (early Littletonian) were subject to a set-back at approx. 9400 BP that lasted some 200 years during which time there appears to have been a reversion to the unstable soils characteristic of earlier times. The possibility of an early post-glacial climatic oscillation is discussed. In the zonation scheme, attention is drawn to the decline of hazel pollen at approx. 8600 BP which appears to represent a turning point in woodland development. The mire surface was invaded by pines in the Late Boreal period. The decline of the pine pollen curve at the Boreal-Atlantic transition (our S: VI-S: VII pollen zone boundary, dated to approx. 7000 BP) is discussed in relation to evidence of burning and possible human activity. Neolithic forest clearance activity on a minor scale is attested at the elm decline which at Sluggan falls rather late in the usual range for this horizon, at approx. 4900 BP. Major episodes of forest clearance took place in the Bronze Age. Thereafter woodland largely regenerated before further clearance starting in the seventh century AD which must have become substantial by Viking times. The local woodlands appear to have recovered again, however, and despite some further clearance in the Late Anglo-Norman period persisted substantially until relatively recent times. The possibility of climatic influences on the later vegetational history is discussed, particularly in relation to declines of the pollen curves of elm at approx. 4200 BP and AD 300, and of pine at approx. 3800 BP.},

The variability of sediment accumulation rates is underestimated by CLAM but overestimated by Bacon and Bchron.
