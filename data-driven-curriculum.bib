  abstract = {Abstract                            The modern analog technique typically uses a distance metric to determine the dissimilarity between fossil and modern biological assemblages. Despite this quantitative approach, interpretation of distance metrics is usually qualitative and rules for selection of analogs tend to be               ad hoc               . We present a statistical tool, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides a framework for identifying analogs from distance metrics. If modern assemblages are placed into groups (e.g., biomes), this method can (1) evaluate the ability of different distance metrics to distinguish among groups, (2) objectively identify thresholds of the distance metric for determining analogs, and (3) compute a likelihood ratio and a Bayesian probability that a modern group is an analog for an unknown (fossil) assemblage. Applied to a set of 1689 modern pollen assemblages from eastern North America classified into eight biomes, ROC analysis confirmed that the squared-chord distance (SCD) outperforms most other distance metrics. The optimal threshold increased when more dissimilar biomes were compared. The probability of an analog vs no-analog result (a likelihood ratio) increased sharply when SCD decreased below the optimal threshold, indicating a nonlinear relationship between SCD and the probability of analog. Probabilities of analog computed for a postglacial pollen record at Tannersville Bog (Pennsylvania, USA) identified transitions between biomes and periods of no analog.},

  abstract = {Paleoecological data are integral to ecological and evolutionary analyses. First, they provide an opportunity to study ecological and evolutionary interactions between communities and abiotic environments across time scales. Second, they allow us to study the long-term outcomes of processes that occur infrequently, such as megadroughts, hurricanes, and rapid climate change. Third, the past allows us to study ecological processes in the absence of widespread anthropogenic influence. The R package neotoma, described here, obtains and manipulates data from the NeotomaPaleoecological Database (Neotoma Database: http://www.neotomadb.org). The Neotoma Database is a public-domain searchable repository for multiproxypaleoecological records spanning the past 5 million years. The Neotoma Database provides the data and cyberinfrastructure to study spatiotemporal dynamics of species and communities from the Pliocene to the present; neotoma provides a user interface to enable these studies. neotoma searches the Neotoma Database using terms that can include location, taxon name, or dataset type (e.g., pollen, vertebrate fauna, ostracode) using the Database's Application Programming Interface (API). The package returns a set of nested metadata associated with the site, including the full assemblage record, geochronological data to enable the rebuilding of age models, dataset metadata (e.g. age range of samples, date of accession into Neotoma, principal investigator), and site metadata (e.g. location, site name and description). neotoma also provides tools to allow cross-site analysis, including the ability to standardize taxonomies using built-in taxonomies derived from the published literature or user-provided taxonomies. We show how key functions in the neotoma package can be used, by reproducing analytic examples from the published literature focusing on Pinus migration following deglaciation and shifts in mammal species distributions during the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of reconstructing prehistoric climates by using fossil data that have been extracted from lake sediment cores. Such reconstructions promise to provide one of the few ways to validate modern models of climate change. A hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach is presented and its use, inversely, is demonstrated in a relatively small but statistically challenging exercise: the reconstruction of prehistoric climate at Glendalough in Ireland from fossil pollen. This computationally intensive method extends current approaches by explicitly modelling uncertainty and reconstructing entire climate histories. The statistical issues that are raised relate to the use of compositional data (pollen) with covariates (climate) which are available at many modern sites but are missing for the fossil data. The compositional data arise as mixtures and the missing covariates have a temporal structure. Novel aspects of the analysis include a spatial process model for compositional data, local modelling of lattice data, the use, as a prior, of a random walk with long-tailed increments, a two-stage implementation of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and a fast approximate procedure for cross-validation in inverse problems. We present some details, contrasting its reconstructions with those which have been generated by a method in use in the palaeoclimatology literature. We suggest that the method provides a basis for resolving important challenging issues in palaeoclimate research. We draw attention to several challenging statistical issues that need to be overcome.},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Modern analog analysis, the comparison of Quaternary fossil pollen assemblages with modern assemblages, has long been a mainstay of paleoecological and paleoclimatic inference. The logic of analogical inference involves a comparative element (comparison of modern and fossil assemblages to select matches and assess goodness of fit) and a causal element (assumption that the relationships between modern vegetation and derivative pollen assemblages are matched by those between ancient vegetation and fossil pollen assemblages). An array of numerical and statistical tools have been developed to ensure objective, consistent, and quantitative assessments of similarity between pollen assemblages. Divergent or convergent relationships between vegetation and pollen assemblages can arise from a variety of sources, composing a potential source of error in analog analysis, but such errors can be anticipated and minimized. Pollen assemblages lacking modern analogs are well documented for the late-glacial period (17,000\textendash 10,000 years BP) in eastern North America and other regions. Simulated climates for this period also lacked modern analogs owing to increased seasonality of insolation, lowered CO               2               , and persistent ice sheets. Most pollen assemblages from the last glacial maximum (23,000\textendash 20,000 years BP) in eastern North America have modern analogs, but macrofossil and other evidence suggest that the vegetation may have lacked modern analogs, owing to unique climate realizations and perhaps direct effects of lowered CO               2               . Better understanding of the nature of past no-analog vegetation, and the underlying causes, will address important issues in ecology and evolutionary biology and help anticipate biotic responses to the no-analog greenhouse world of the near-future.},

  abstract = {The patterns and drivers of late Quaternary vegetation dynamics in the southeastern United States are poorly understood due to low site density, problematic chronologies, and a paucity of independent paleoclimate proxy records. We present a well-dated (15 accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates) 30,000-yr record from White Pond, South Carolina that consists of high-resolution analyses of fossil pollen, macroscopic charcoal, and Sporormiella spores, and an independent paleotemperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl tetraethers. Between 30,000 and 20,000 cal yr BP, open Pinus-Picea forest grew under cold and dry conditions; elevated Quercus before 26,000 cal yr BP, however, suggest warmer conditions in the Southeast before the last glacial maximum, possibly corresponding to regionally warmer conditions associated with Heinrich event H2. Warming between 19,700 and 10,400 cal yr BP was accompanied by a transition from conifer-dominated to mesic hardwood forest. Sporormiella spores were not detected and charcoal was low during the late glacial period, suggesting megaherbivore grazers and fire were not locally important agents of vegetation change. Pinus returned to dominance during the Holocene, with step-like increases in Pinus at 10,400 and 6400 cal yr BP, while charcoal abundance increased tenfold, likely due to increased biomass burning associated with warmer conditions. Low-intensity surface fires increased after 1200 cal yr BP, possibly related to the establishment of the Mississippian culture in the Southeast.},

Using a global set of {$>$}1100 fossil pollen records, Mottl               et al.               explored the rates of vegetation change over the past 18,000 years (see the Perspective by Overpeck and Breshears). The authors show that the rates of change accelerated markedly during the Late Holocene ({$\sim$}4.6 to 2.9 thousand years ago), even more rapidly than the climate-driven vegetation changes associated with the end of the last glacial period. In addition, the Late Holocene acceleration began for terrestrial communities as a whole, suggesting that the acceleration in turnover over the past two centuries is the tip of a deeper trend.

Using a compilation of 1181 fossil pollen sequences and newly developed statistical methods, we detect a worldwide acceleration in the rates of vegetation compositional change beginning between 4.6 and 2.9 thousand years ago that is globally unprecedented over the past 18,000 years in both magnitude and extent. Late Holocene rates of change equal or exceed the deglacial rates for all continents, which suggests that the scale of human effects on terrestrial ecosystems exceeds even the climate-driven transformations of the last deglaciation.

How eight coefficients responded to differences among modern pollen samples from eastern North America was tested. These coefficients represent three different classes: (1) unweighted coefficients that are most strongly influenced by large-valued pollen types, (2) equal-weight coefficients that weight all pollen types equally but can be too sensitive to variations among rare types, and (3) signal-to-noise coefficients that are intermediate in their weighting of pollen types. The studies with modern pollen allowed definition of critical values for each coefficient, which, when not exceeded, indicate that two pollen samples originate from the same vegetation region. Dissimilarity coefficients were used to compare modern and fossil pollen samples, and modern samples so similar to fossil samples were found that most of three late Quaternary pollen diagrams could be ``reconstructed'' by substituting modern samples for fossil samples. When the coefficients indicated that the fossil spectra had no modern analogs, then the reconstructed diagrams did not match all aspects of the originals. No modern analogs existed for samples from before 9300 yr B.P. at Kirchner Marsh, Minnesota, and from before 11,000 yr B.P. at Wintergreen Lake, Michigan, but modern analogs existed for almost all Holocene samples from these two sites and Brandreth Bog, New York.},

Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international               14               C calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable               14               C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the               14               C ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine               14               C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals.},

These techniques, and others, are increasingly being used to inform public policy on environmental pollution and conservation practices. These methods and other functionality in analogue are illustrated using the Surface Waters Acidification Project diatom:pH training set and diatom counts on samples of a sediment core from the Round Loch of Glenhead, Galloway, Scotland.

In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used Loess-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the Loess fit (e.g., span width, degree of polynomial). Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike Loess, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter {$\delta$}15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3,000-year alkenone record from Braya-S\o, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

  abstract = {A radiocarbon-dated pollen diagram from a typical lowland raised bog in County Antrim is presented, together with a limited stratigraphic study. The record of vegetational development described is unusually complete for the last 12 500 years. The pollen diagram is divided into ten pollen zones which it is hoped will be useful to the non-specialist. A visual summary is given in Figure 5. Deposits of the Midlandian late-glacial are contained in a small basin beneath the reedswamp and later Sphagnum peats of the mire. Birch woodland developed early in the sequence (approx. 12 350 BP) in the Bolling interstadial period. Declines of this woodland occurred at approx. 12 200 BP and 11 700 BP. The probability that the 12 200 BP decline represents the end of the thermal maximum of the late-glacial interstadial is discussed. In the period equivalent to the classical Allerod interstadial, the vegetation appears to have been essentially treeless. A summary comparison of Irish Late-glacial pollen assemblage zones is given. All radiocarbon dates are conventional, without calibration. The birch woods of the early post-glacial (early Littletonian) were subject to a set-back at approx. 9400 BP that lasted some 200 years during which time there appears to have been a reversion to the unstable soils characteristic of earlier times. The possibility of an early post-glacial climatic oscillation is discussed. In the zonation scheme, attention is drawn to the decline of hazel pollen at approx. 8600 BP which appears to represent a turning point in woodland development. The mire surface was invaded by pines in the Late Boreal period. The decline of the pine pollen curve at the Boreal-Atlantic transition (our S: VI-S: VII pollen zone boundary, dated to approx. 7000 BP) is discussed in relation to evidence of burning and possible human activity. Neolithic forest clearance activity on a minor scale is attested at the elm decline which at Sluggan falls rather late in the usual range for this horizon, at approx. 4900 BP. Major episodes of forest clearance took place in the Bronze Age. Thereafter woodland largely regenerated before further clearance starting in the seventh century AD which must have become substantial by Viking times. The local woodlands appear to have recovered again, however, and despite some further clearance in the Late Anglo-Norman period persisted substantially until relatively recent times. The possibility of climatic influences on the later vegetational history is discussed, particularly in relation to declines of the pollen curves of elm at approx. 4200 BP and AD 300, and of pine at approx. 3800 BP.},

Four widely used age\textendash depth modelling routines \textendash{} CLAM, OxCal, Bacon and Bchron \textendash{} were tested using radiocarbon dates simulated from varved sediment stratigraphies. All methods produce mean age\textendash depth models that are close to the true varve age, but the uncertainty estimation differs considerably among models. Age uncertainties are usually underestimated by CLAM, whereas age uncertainties produced by Bchron are often too large. With OxCal and Bacon, the setting of model-specific parameters influences the estimated uncertainties, which vary from too large to too small. The variability of sediment accumulation rates is underestimated by CLAM but overestimated by Bacon and Bchron. Bayesian age\textendash depth models mainly improve the assessment of uncertainties of age\textendash depth models.},

  abstract = {Plant formations different from any extant today apparently were widespread in North America and Europe during the last deglaciation, produced by the independent biogeographic responses of plant taxa to climate change. Dissimilarity analyses of modern and fossil pollen samples in eastern North America show that the unique plant associations centered around the Great Lakes at 14 000 calendar years before present (yr BP), with high dissimilarities during 17 000\textendash 12 000 yr BP. The late-glacial fossil pollen assemblages are characterized by (1) high abundances of boreal conifers such as spruce and larch relative to their Holocene values, (2) high abundances of herbaceous types (sedge, sage, and ragweed), (3) high abundances of broad-leaved deciduous types (ash, hornbeam, poplar, hazel, and willow), and (4) the low abundance or absence of pine, alder, and birch. When the fossil pollen samples are assigned to biomes using the affinity score technique, the late Pleistocene pollen samples are assigned to mixed parkland, a biome that is not extant in North America today. The fastest vegetational changes occurred 13 000\textendash 11 000 yr BP, when the late Pleistocene vegetation reorganized into the Holocene biomes, which have persisted to today. Simulations by the Community Climate Model, version 1 (CCM1), suggest that late-glacial climates were also unlike modern climates, featuring a ``hypercontinental'' mixture of colder-than-present winters, warmer-than-present summers, and lower-than-present precipitation. Dissimilarity analyses of the pollen data and CCM1 simulations for 21 000, 16 000, 14 000, 11 000, and 6000 yr BP show that (1) the temporal and spatial distribution of high dissimilarities in the vegetation (relative to present) coincide with dissimilarities in simulated climate, (2) the timing and spatial distribution of changes in the vegetation and simulated climate also agree, and (3) the largest climatic and vegetational changes follow the peak period of dissimilarity from present. Taken together, these three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the no-analogue plant associations were in equilibrium with orbital- and millennial-scale climate change. Nonclimatic factors such as low atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the presence of now-extinct megafauna species may have increased the openness of the Pleistocene vegetation, but by themselves cannot explain the observed mixture of boreal, temperate, and herbaceous taxa in the no-analogue pollen assemblages, nor can they explain the prevalence of no-analogue pollen samples during the late glacial period.},
