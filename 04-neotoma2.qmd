# The neotoma2 package {#neotoma2-sec}

## Introduction

This series of exercises is designed to give you hands-on practice in using APIs and the `neotoma2` R package (Goring et al, 2015), both for practical reasons and for  insights into how open-data systems work.  The primary purpose of `neotoma2` is to pass data from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (Neotoma DB) server into your local R environment.  Neotoma relies on Application Programming Interfaces ([APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) to communicate with the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, so we'll begin with an introduction to APIs.  

Much of this exercise is based on [A Simple Workflow](https://open.neotomadb.org/EPD_binder/simple_workflow.html) and [A Not so Simple Workflow](https://open.neotomadb.org/EPD_binder/complex_workflow.html) tutorials that were originally developed for a workshop convened by the European Pollen Database in June 2022.  Today we'll keep the initial analyses relatively simple, so that you can focus on learning the data structures and functions used by `neotoma2`.  A hard-won lesson for a practicing data scientist is how much time and attention goes into data handling!

`neotoma2` is available from GitHub and can be installed in R using the `devtools` package via:

```r
devtools::install_github('NeotomaDB/neotoma2')
library(neotoma2)
```

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Use the Neotoma API
* Search for sites using site names and geographic parameters
* Filter results using temporal and spatial parameters
* Obtain sample information for the selected datasets
* Perform basic analysis including the use of climate data from rasters

This series of exercises is designed to give you hands-on practice in using APIs and the `neotoma2` R package, both for practical reasons and for insights into how open-data systems work. `neotoma2`’s primary purpose is to pass data from the Neotoma DB server into your local R computing environment. Neotoma relies on Application Programming Interfaces ([APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)) to communicate with the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, so we’ll begin with an introduction to APIs.

## The Wide, Wide World of APIs

The Neotoma Paleoecology Database is a relational database, hosted on servers at [Penn State’s Center for Environmental Informatics](https://sites.psu.edu/environmentalinformatics/). For security reasons, direct access to these servers is quite limited, and available only to a few Neotoma and CEI programmers.

**APIs** offer public access points into Neotoma that anyone can use. Each API is basically a function: you provide the API with a set of operational parameters, and it returns a set of data or metadata. Each API hence is designed to support one particular task or set of tasks; it offers a narrow window into the larger Neotoma DB. [REST-ful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) follow a particular set of standards that allow them to be read by web browsers (i.e. within the HTTP protocol) and return data objects, typically in HTML, XML, JSON or other human- & machine-readable formats.

The [Neotoma APIs](https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/) provide a series of functions for retrieving different kinds of data from Neotoma DB. Data objects are returned in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. For this exercise, we strongly recommend adding an extension to your browser that formats the JSON output to make it easier to read, such as [JSONView](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/) for Firefox, and [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) for Chrome.

The APIs for Neotoma can be found here: https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/. Look through the lists of different APIs and find the one labeled `GET /v2.0/data/sites/{siteid}`. Then, click on the Try It Out button at right, enter 666 into the site identifier box, and click Execute. Then scroll down. You  should see some example code in curl format (ignore this) and as a URL. If you scroll down further, you’ll see the actual data return, in JSON format. JSON is a structured data format designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable. It looks like a nested series of lists.  

Now, let's go from the API sandbox to direct use of the API URLs in a browser.  Copy and paste the below URL into the URL box in your browser:

`https://api.neotomadb.org/v2.0/data/sites?sitename=%devil%`

This should open a new web page in your browser with a returned JSON object. For this search, the JSON object should include 16 or more sites with the name ‘devil’ in them (note the use of % as wildcards), including Devil’s Lake, WI. The opening line "status" = "success" means that the API ran successfully. Note that it is possible for an API to run successfully but return no data! For example, try:

`https://api.neotomadb.org/v2.0/data/sites?sitename=devil`

Here, "status" = "success" but data=[], i.e. the API successfully reported back to you that no sites in Neotoma have the exact name of ‘devil’.

Once you know what an API is, you will quickly see how widely these are used by modern browsers and websites.  For example, try:

`https://www.google.com/search?q=neotoma&ei=-xE_Y4XHA8GF0PEPi6-p-AU&ved=0ahUKEwjFsPSAksz6AhXBAjQIHYtXCl8Q4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=neotoma&gs_lcp=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&sclient=gws-wiz`

Note that in this demo use of the Google search API, all we did is enter 'neotoma' in the standard Google search window and then Google produced and formatted the above API query with a ?search parameter (and who knows what else is lurking in that massive text parameter...)

OK, now your turn:  

**Exercise Question 1** Use the *sites* API to retrieve site data for sites of interest.  The *sites* API has a few different parameters, so try out options.  Try copying and pasting the URLs into the address line of your browser, and then hitting return.  In your homework exercise, provide at least two *sites* API calls (as URLs) with a comment line for each that explains what the API command is doing.
