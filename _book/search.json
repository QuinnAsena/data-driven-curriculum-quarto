    "text": "1 Introduction\nWelcome to palaeoecological data-science! This book is designed as a reproducible workflow for a semester-long course in palaeoecological data-science with the accompany publication XXX. For students, the book is carefully designed as both an educational resource with working examples and exercises, and as a coding resource that can be transferred to your own analyses. The cautionary note being that the most appropriate analyses (e.g., NMDS or GAMs?), or parameterisation of the analyses will likely be different for your data. To help, the key resources associated with each analytical method are cited throughout. Some R knowledge is assumed but we have tried to make it as easy-to-follow as possible with reproducible, working code chunks.\nFor instructors, the repository can be forked and edited to suit different needs. The pollen data from Devil’s Lake (Wisconsin, USA) used as an example dataset can be swapped out for a different region or proxy (e.g., diatoms) and the workflow edited to accommodate for the change. We would love to know how the resource is adapted and used so drop us an email and let us know!\nIf you do use this resource for teaching or learning please cite it: DOI XXX. This will help us keep track of the impact and use of such open-source curricula and inform future work.\nThis curriculum is an open-source and we welcome suggestions for improvement from the community that will be reviewed by the developers. We will also keep the resource up-to-date with the latest package improvements. The development of this curriculum is tracked with version control using git and the renv package is used to control package versions. section perhaps should be edited and moved to readme with instructions for raising github issues"

Community-curated means that Neotoma data are augmented and maintained by a community of experts, with many scientists contributing their data to Neotoma and actively working to curate and improve these data. Explorer is a graphical interface that is very handy for a first-pass search, discovery, and viewing of paleoecological data, typically exploring a few sites at a time.

    "section": "4.1 Part 1: Background",
    "text": "4.1 Part 1: Background\nA foundational difference between geology and ecology is that, for geologists, time is an unknown variable that must be estimated with uncertainty. In contrast, most ecologists can assume that the temporal coordinates of their observations are known precisely, with zero uncertainty. Fortunately, geochronologists have a wide variety of natural clocks, thanks to the constant decay rates of radioactive isotopes. Each isotope has a unique decay rate, and so each is appropriate for particular timescales.\nFor the last 50,000 years, radiocarbon (14C), with its half-life of 5,730 years, is by far the most common form of radiometric dating. (Beyond 10 half-lives, so much of a radioactive substance has decayed away that it becomes immeasurable.) Radiocarbon is the mainstay of Quaternary dating and archaeology.\nIn Quaternary paleoecology, radiocarbon dating is expensive – a single sample typically costs $300 to $500 – so usually a given lake-sediment record will have only a scattering (ca. 5 to 30) of radiocarbon dates and other age controls. Other kinds of age controls include volcanic ash layers (tephras), 210Pb (half-life: 22.6 yrs), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates, historic events such as the rise in Ambrosia pollen abundances associated with EuroAmerican land clearance, etc. An age-depth model must be constructed to estimate the age of sediments not directly associated with an age control. In multi-site data syntheses, the number of age controls, their precision, and their likely accuracy are all fundamental indicators of data quality (e.g. Blois et al. 2011; Mottl et al. 2021).\nTo estimate ages for depths lacking radiocarbon date, an age-depth model is required. Age-depth models are fitted to the available age controls (age estimates with uncertainty for individual depths) and provide estimates of age as a function of depth, for all depths and ages within the temporal bounds of the model."

    "text": "4.2 Part 2: Code\nHere we will gain practice in working with age-depth models of various kind, and assessing their age estimates and uncertainty. We’ll begin with a bit of practice in calibrating radiocarbon years to calendar years and comparing the resulting age estimates from different calibration curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages required for this section\n\n\n\nWe will be using Bchron for calibration and Bayesian age-depth modelling. Notably rbacon is another commonly used package, see Trachsel and Telford (2017) for a discussion on age-depth models. We will also be fitting some interpolation and linear models using BASE-R. Remember you must have packages both installed and loaded, often loading a package is done via the library(packagename) function. The following code using the pacman package takes care of installation and loading in one go.\n\n# Load up the package\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\")\npacman::p_load(Bchron, splines) # splines comes with BASE-R\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Calibration of Radiocarbon Dates\nA complication in radiocarbon dating is that the initial calculation of a radiocarbon age assumes, by convention, that the amount of radiocarbon in the atmosphere is constant over time. See Bronk Ramsey (2008) for a good overview of 14C dating. This assumption is untrue, so all radiocarbon age estimates must be post-hoc calibrated using a calibration curve that is based on compiling radiocarbon dates of materials that have precise independent age estimates (e.g. tree rings, corals). The IntCal series (IntCal04, IntCal09, IntCal13, IntCal20) is the community standard for calibrating radiocarbon dates to age estimates in calendar years (e.g., Reimer et al. 2020). The conversion from radiocarbon to calendar years usually further increases the uncertainty of age estimates.\nYet another complication in radiocarbon dating is that different calibration curves need to be used for the Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere and for the atmosphere vs. oceans, due to different residence times of 14C in these different reservoirs. For example, atmospheric radiocarbon that diffuses into the surface oceans usually will reside for centuries before phytoplankton biologically fix it through photosynthesis, which will lead marine 14C to be depleted (and ‘too old’) relative to atmospheric 14C. Use the wrong calibration curve and your age estimate will be inaccurate!\n\n4.2.1.1 Calibrating radiocarbon dates in R\nHere we’ll experiment with calibrating radiocarbon dates, using various calibration curves. Radiocarbon dated samples come back from the lab with a radiocarbon age and standard deviation, among other information. These two bits of information are used to calibrate the radiocarbon dates to estimated ages. R packages may have useful vignettes (package tutorials) and built-in datasets that provide handy test templates. The following code is modified from the Bchron vignette.\n\nCodeSummaryPlotsCalibration curve plots\n\n\n\nages = BchronCalibrate(ages=c(3445,11553,7456), \n                        ageSds=c(50,230,110), \n                        calCurves=c('intcal20','intcal20','intcal20'))\n\n\n\n\nsummary(ages)\n\n95% Highest density regions for Date1\n$`94.4%`\n[1] 3572 3834\n\n\n95% Highest density regions for Date2\n$`0.4%`\n[1] 13004 13025\n\n$`77.9%`\n[1] 13059 13874\n\n$`16.4%`\n[1] 13923 14012\n\n\n95% Highest density regions for Date3\n$`94.6%`\n[1] 8022 8423\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(ages)\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(ages, includeCal = TRUE, fillCol = 'red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output summary indicates the range of the highest density regions (i.e., the most likely ‘real’ age range of the sample). The plot function in Bchron outputs a ggplot object of the high density regions of the most likely ages.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Types of Age-Depth Models\nDifferent kinds of age-depth models exist, each with their own underlying assumptions and behavior. In the list below, #1-4 are classical or traditional forms of age-depth models, but Bayesian models are now the norm. The packages rbacon (usually referred to as ‘bacon’) and Bchron are the current standards for Bayesian age-depth modelling. Before going to bayesian models, we’ll begin with the classics.\n\nLinear interpolation, a.k.a. ‘connect the dots,’ in which straight lines are drawn between each depth-adjacent pair of age controls.\nLinear regression (\\(y=b0~ + b1x\\); \\(y=\\)time and \\(x=\\)depth; \\(b0\\) and \\(b1\\) are constants), in which a single straight line is fitted through the entire set of age controls. In ordinary linear regression (OLS), the chosen line will minimize the y-dimension distances of individual points to the line. Standard OLS assumes that all observations are normally distributed, which is a poor assumption for calibrated radiocarbon dates.\nPolynomials, also fitted to the entire set of age controls (\\(y= b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + …bnx^n\\)), are an extension of linear regression, with additional terms for \\(x^2\\), \\(x^3\\), etc. Some arbitrary maximum n is chosen, usually in the range of 3 to 5. These are called ‘third-order polynomials,’ ‘fifth-order polynomials,’ etc.\nSplines, which are a special kind of polynomial function that are locally fitted to subsets of the age controls, and then smoothly interpolated between points. (Several different formulas can be used to generate splines; common forms include cubic, smooth, monotonic, and LOWESS).\nBayesian age models (e.g. bacon, bchron, oxcal, etc.). Bayesian models differ in detail, but all combine a statistical representation of prior knowledge with the new data (i.e. the age controls at a site) to build an age-depth model with posterior estimates of age for any given depth. Bayesian models are now widely used because\n\nthey allow the incorporation of prior knowledge (e.g., from coring many lakes, we now have decent estimates of typical sediment accumulation rates, Goring et al. (2012));\nthey can handle highly irregular probability distribution functions such as those for radiocarbon dates after calibration; and as a result\nthey generally do a better job of describing uncertainty than traditional age-depth models.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.1 Classical age-depth models\nClassical models are now out-dated methods (Blaauw et al. 2018), but it is useful to understand how they work as literature before the relatively recent development of Bayesian methods has relied on them. Let’s explore some classical methods of age-depth modelling using one of the datasets included with the Bchron package. The data are from a core in Northern Ireland; Sluggan Bog Smith and Goddard (1991), and can be called via:\n\ndata(Sluggan) # Call the data from Bchron\nprint(Sluggan) # Check out the data\n\n\nLinear interpolationLinear regressionPolynomial regressionCubic splines\n\n\nLinear interpolation predicts ages by simply, drawing a line between successive dated samples. This method assumes that there is a constant age-depth relationship between samples. An assumption that is unlikely to be true, especially of cores with fewer dated samples than Sluggan Moss.\n\ninterp_ages <- approx(x = Sluggan$ages, y = Sluggan$position) # use the function approx() to interpolate between ages\nplot(x = interp_ages$x, y = interp_ages$y, type = 'l') # Plot the interpolated data\npoints(x = Sluggan$ages, y = Sluggan$position, cex = 1.5, col = 'red') # overlay the original age points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression provides a line of best fit through the dated samples. This method assumes a constant age-depth relationship across all samples, also unlikely to be true depending on processes affecting the core during its formation.\n\nmod_ages <- lm(Sluggan$position ~ Sluggan$ages) # Create a linear regression model\nplot(x = Sluggan$ages, y = Sluggan$position, cex = 1.5, col = 'red') # Plot the original ages\nabline(mod_ages) # add the regression line from the regression model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolynomial regression allows a curve to be fit through the data. The amount the curve ‘wiggles’ depends on the order of the polynomial fit to the data. Polynomial regression has the risk of being over-fit.\n\nx <- Sluggan$ages # Renaming the variables because the predict function below is fussy about the input name\ny <- Sluggan$position\npoly_ages <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 3))\n\nplot(x = Sluggan$ages, y = Sluggan$position, cex = 1.5, col = 'red')\nage_range <- seq(from = range(Sluggan$ages)[1], to = range(Sluggan$ages)[2], length.out = 250)\nlines(age_range, predict(poly_ages, data.frame(x = age_range)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplines are a class of functions including, for example, smoothing splines or cubic splines. Cubic splines are pieve-wise polynomials locally between ‘knots’. That is the data are split into bins that are fit independently using. By default, the bs() function uses a third degree polynomial. Without providing knots the fit will look the same as a third degree polynomial regression.\n\ncubic_ages <- lm(y ~ bs(x, knots = c(1000, 6000, 12000)))\nplot(x = Sluggan$ages, y = Sluggan$position, cex = 1.5, col = 'red')\nlines(age_range, predict(cubic_ages, data.frame(x = age_range)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause classical age-depth modelling is rarely used now we are not going to delve further into the statistical details of the best way of fitting each model (e.g., the number of knots to use for fitting a cubic spline).\nOne of the issues with classical age-depth modelling is that uncertainty decreases with fewer datapoints.\n\n\n4.2.2.2 Bayesian age-depth models\nNow let’s see what the latest methods show for the same dataset.\n\nCodeSummaryPlot\n\n\nNote that all the values provided to the arguments are contained in the Sluggan dataframe.

    "text": "5.2 The Wide, Wide World of APIs\nThe Neotoma Paleoecology Database is a relational database, hosted on servers at Penn State’s Center for Environmental Informatics. For security reasons, direct access to these servers is quite limited, and available only to a few Neotoma and CEI programmers.\nAPIs offer public access points into Neotoma that anyone can use. Each API is basically a function: you provide the API with a set of operational parameters, and it returns a set of data or metadata. Each API hence is designed to support one particular task or set of tasks; it offers a narrow window into the larger Neotoma DB. REST-ful APIs follow a particular set of standards that allow them to be read by web browsers (i.e. within the HTTP protocol) and return data objects, typically in HTML, XML, JSON or other human- & machine-readable formats.\nThe Neotoma APIs provide a series of functions for retrieving different kinds of data from Neotoma DB. Data objects are returned in JSON format. For this exercise, we strongly recommend adding an extension to your browser that formats the JSON output to make it easier to read, such as JSONView for Firefox, and JSON Formatter for Chrome.\nThe APIs for Neotoma can be found here: https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/. Look through the lists of different APIs and find the one labeled GET /v2.0/data/sites/{siteid}. Then, click on the Try It Out button at right, enter 666 into the site identifier box, and click Execute. Then scroll down. You should see some example code in curl format (ignore this) and as a URL. If you scroll down further, you’ll see the actual data return, in JSON format. JSON is a structured data format designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable. It looks like a nested series of lists.\nNow, let’s go from the API sandbox to direct use of the API URLs in a browser. Copy and paste the below URL into the URL box in your browser:\nhttps://api.neotomadb.org/v2.0/data/sites?sitename=%devil%\nThis should open a new web page in your browser with a returned JSON object. For this search, the JSON object should include 16 or more sites with the name ‘devil’ in them (note the use of % as wildcards), including Devil’s Lake, WI. The opening line “status” = “success” means that the API ran successfully. Note that it is possible for an API to run successfully but return no data! For example, try:\nhttps://api.neotomadb.org/v2.0/data/sites?sitename=devil\nHere, “status” = “success” but data=[], i.e. the API successfully reported back to you that no sites in Neotoma have the exact name of ‘devil’.\nOnce you know what an API is, you will quickly see how widely these are used by modern browsers and websites. For example, try:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=neotoma&ei=-xE_Y4XHA8GF0PEPi6-p-AU&ved=0ahUKEwjFsPSAksz6AhXBAjQIHYtXCl8Q4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=neotoma&gs_lcp=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&sclient=gws-wiz\nNote that in this demo use of the Google search API, all we did is enter ‘neotoma’ in the standard Google search window and then Google produced and formatted the above API query with a ?search parameter (and who knows what else is lurking in that massive text parameter…)\nOK, now your turn:\nExercise question 1 Use the sites API to retrieve site data for sites of interest. The sites API has a few different parameters, so try out options. Try copying and pasting the URLs into the address line of your browser, and then hitting return. In your homework exercise, provide at least two sites API calls (as URLs) with a comment line for each that explains what the API command is doing."

We load the packages using the pacman package, which will automatically install the packages if they do not currently exist in your set of packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages required for this section\n\n\n\nneotoma2 is available from GitHub and can be installed in R using the devtools package via devtools:\n\n# Load up the package\nif (!require(\"devtools\")) install.packages(\"devtools\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\") # devtools allows us to install from online repositories\ndevtools::install_github('NeotomaDB/neotoma2') # pacman does not search github curently so we will install neotoma2 separately\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\")\npacman::p_load(dplyr, ggplot2, neotoma2, sf, geojsonsf, leaflet, raster, DT, rioja) # Pacman will load neotoma2\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Good coding practice: explicitly naming packages and functions\nDifferent packages in R are created independently by different teams of developers, and it’s very common for two different packages to use the same function names (the English language is finite…). This can lead to coding errors if you call a function that you know is in one package, but R guesses wrongly that you wanted a function of the same name from an entirely different package. For example, for a function like filter(), which exists in both neotoma2 and other packages such as dplyr, you may see an error that looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh no! 😱\n\n\n\nError in UseMethod(\"filter\") :\n no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class \"sites\"\n\n\nYou can avoid this error by explicitly naming which package has the function that you want to use, through the standard convention of double colons (package.name::function.name). For example, using neotoma2::filter() tells R explicitly that you want to use the filter() function in the neotoma2 package, not some other package version.\nSummary: It’s good coding practice to always explicitly link packages to the functions that you are using! Your future self will thank you.\n\n\n5.3.2 Getting Help with Neotoma (APIs, R, Explorer, Tilia, …)\nFor Geog523, the class Slack workspace is your first and best option. If you’re planning on working with Neotoma more in the future, please join us on Slack, where we manage a channel specifically for questions about the R package. You may also wish to join Neotoma’s Google Groups mailing list, and if so contact us to be added."

    "text": "5.4 Neotoma2: Site Searches: get_sites()\nMany users of Neotoma first want to search and explore data at the site level. There are several ways to find sites in neotoma2, but we think of sites primarily as spatial objects. They have names, locations, and are found within geopolitical units. However, sites themselves do not have associated information about taxa, dataset types, or ages. sites instead are simply the container into which we add that information. So, when we search for sites we can search by:\n\nsiteid\nsitename\nlocation\naltitude (maximum and minimum)\ngeopolitical unit\n\n\n5.4.0.1 Searching by Site Name: sitename=\"%Devil%\"\nWe may know exactly what site we’re looking for (“Devil’s Lake”), or have an approximate guess for the site name (for example, we know it’s something like “Devil Pond”, or “Devil’s Hole”).\nWe use the general format: get_sites(sitename=\"XXXXX\") for searching by name.\nPostgreSQL (and the API) uses the percent sign as a wildcard. So \"%Devil%\" would pick up “Devils Lake” for us (and would pick up “Devil’s Canopy Cave”). Note that the search query is case insensitive, so \"%devil%\" will work.\nIf we want an individual record we can use the siteid, which is a unique identifier for each site: .\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\ndevil_sites <- neotoma2::get_sites(sitename = \"%Devil%\")\nplotLeaflet(devil_sites)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise question 2 How many sites have the name ‘clear’ in them? Show both your code and provide the total count.\n\n\n5.4.0.2 Searching by Location: loc=c()\nThe neotoma package used a bounding box for locations, structured as a vector of latitude and longitude values: c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax). The neotoma2 R package supports both this simple bounding box and also more complex spatial objects, using the sf package. Using the sf package allows us to more easily work with raster and polygon data in R, and to select sites using more complex spatial objects. The loc parameter works with the simple vector, WKT, geoJSON objects and native sf objects in R. Note however that the neotoma2 package is a wrapper for a simple API call using a URL (see APIs above), and URL strings have a maximum limit of 1028 characters, so the API currently cannot accept very long/complex spatial objects.\nAs an example of different ways that you can search by location, let’s say you wanted to search for all sites in the state of Michigan. Here are three spatial representations of Michigan: 1) a geoJSON list with five elements, 2) WKT, and 3) bounding box representation. And, as a fourth variant, we’ve transformed the mich$geoJSON element to an object for the sf package. Any of these four spatial representations work with the neotoma2 package.\n\nmich <- list(geoJSON = '{\"type\": \"Polygon\",\n        \"coordinates\": [[\n            [-86.95, 41.55],\n            [-82.43, 41.55],\n            [-82.43, 45.88],\n            [-86.95, 45.88],\n            [-86.95, 41.55]\n            ]]}',\n        WKT = 'POLYGON ((-86.95 41.55,\n                         -82.43 41.55,\n                         -82.43 45.88,\n                         -86.95 45.88,\n                         -86.95 41.55))',\n        bbox = c(-86.95, 41.55, -82.43, 45.88))\n\nmich$sf <- geojsonsf::geojson_sf(mich$geoJSON)[[1]]\n\nmich_sites <- neotoma2::get_sites(loc = mich$geoJSON, all_data = TRUE)\n\nYou can always simply plot() the sites objects, but this won’t show any geographic context. The leaflet::plotLeaflet() function returns a leaflet() map, and allows you to further customize it, or add additional spatial data (like our original bounding polygon, mich$sf, which works directly with the R leaflet package):\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\nneotoma2::plotLeaflet(mich_sites) %>%\n  leaflet::addPolygons(map = .,\n                       data = mich$sf,\n                       color = \"green\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise question 3 Which state has more sites in Neotoma, Minnesota or Wisconsin? How many in each state? Provide both code and answer.\n\n\n5.4.0.3 Helper Functions for Site Searches\n\n\n\nNeotoma R Package Universal Modeling Language (UML) diagram.\n\n\nIf we look at the UML diagram for the objects in the neotoma2 R package, we can see that there are a set of functions that can operate on sites. As we add to sites objects, using get_datasets() or get_downloads(), we are able to use more of these helper functions. We can use functions like summary() to get a more complete sense of the types of data in this set of sites.\nThe following code gives the summary table. We do some R magic here to change the way the data is displayed (turning it into a datatable() object using the DT package), but the main function is the summary() call.\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\nneotoma2::summary(mich_sites)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that there are no chronologies associated with the site objects. This is because, at present, we have not pulled in the dataset information we need. All we know from get_sites() are the kinds of datasets we have.\n\n\n5.4.1 Searching for Datasets\nNow that we know how to search for sites, we can start to search for datasets. As we’ve discussed before, in the Neotoma data model, each site can contain one or more collection units, each of which can contain one or more datasets. Similarly, a sites object contains collectionunits which contain datasets. From the table above, we can see that some of the sites we’ve looked at contain pollen data. However, so far we have only downloaded the sites data object and not any of the actual pollen data, it’s just that (for convenience) the sites API returns some information about datasets, to make it easier to navigate the records.\nWith a sites object we can directly call get_datasets(), to pull in more metadata about the datasets. At any time we can use datasets() to get more information about any datasets that a sites object may contain. Compare the output of datasets(mich_sites) to the output of a similar call using the following:\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\nmich_datasets <- neotoma2::get_datasets(mich_sites, all_data = TRUE)\n\ndatasets(mich_datasets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise question 4: How many different kinds of datasets are available at Devil’s Lake, WI? Show both code and answer. Ensure that your code just retrieves datasets for just this single site.\n\n\n5.4.2 Filter Records\nIf we choose to pull in information about only a single dataset type, or if there is additional filtering we want to do before we download the data, we can use the filter() function. For example, if we only want pollen records, and want records with known chronologies, we can filter:\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\nmich_pollen <- mich_datasets %>%\n  neotoma2::filter(datasettype == \"pollen\" & !is.na(age_range_young))\n\nneotoma2::summary(mich_pollen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, that we are filtering on two conditions. (You may want to look up the operators being used in the above code: ==, &, and ! to understand what they accomplish in the code.) We can see now that the data table looks different, and there are fewer total sites.\n\n\n5.4.3 Retrieving sample() data.\nThe sample data are the actual data that scientists usually want - counts of pollen grains, lists of vertebrate fossil occurrences, etc. Because sample data can have fairly large data volumes (each dataset may contain many samples), which can strain server bandwidth and local computing memory, we try to call get_downloads() after we’ve done our preliminary filtering. After get_datasets(), you have enough information to filter based on location, time bounds, and dataset type. When we move to get_downloads() we can do more fine-tuned filtering at the analysis unit or taxon level.\nThe following command may take a few moments to run. (If it takes too long, we have stored an already-downloaded version of the function output as an RDS data file that you can load directly into R.)\n\nmich_dl <- mich_pollen %>% get_downloads(all_data = TRUE)\n\n...........................\n\n# mich_dl <- readRDS('data/mich_dl.rds')\n\nOnce we’ve downloaded the sample data, we now have information for each site about all the associated collection units, the datasets, and, for each dataset, all the samples associated with the datasets. To extract all the samples we can call:\n\nallSamp <- samples(mich_dl)\n\nWhen we’ve done this, we get a data.frame that is 38062 rows long and 37 columns wide. The reason the table is so wide is that we are returning data in a long format. Each row contains all the information you should need to properly interpret it:\n\n\n [1] \"age\"             \"agetype\"         \"ageolder\"        \"ageyounger\"     \n [5] \"chronologyid\"    \"chronologyname\"  \"units\"           \"value\"          \n [9] \"context\"         \"element\"         \"taxonid\"         \"symmetry\"       \n[13] \"taxongroup\"      \"elementtype\"     \"variablename\"    \"ecologicalgroup\"\n[17] \"analysisunitid\"  \"sampleanalyst\"   \"sampleid\"        \"depth\"          \n[21] \"thickness\"       \"samplename\"      \"datasetid\"       \"database\"       \n[25] \"datasettype\"     \"age_range_old\"   \"age_range_young\" \"datasetnotes\"   \n[29] \"siteid\"          \"sitename\"        \"lat\"             \"long\"           \n[33] \"area\"            \"sitenotes\"       \"description\"     \"elev\"           \n[37] \"collunitid\"     \n\n\nFor some dataset types, or analyses some of these columns may not be needed, however, for other dataset types they may be critically important. To allow the neotoma2 package to be as useful as possible for the community we’ve included as many as we can.\n\n5.4.3.1 Extracting Taxa\nIf you want to know what taxa we have in a dataset, you can use the helper function taxa() on the sites object. The taxa() function gives us, not only the unique taxa, but two additional columns, sites and samples, that tell us how many sites the taxa appear in, and how many samples the taxa appear in, to help us better understand how common individual taxa are.\n\nCodeResults\n\n\n\nneotomatx <- neotoma2::taxa(mich_dl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taxonid values can be linked to the taxonid column in the samples(). This allows us to build taxon harmonization tables if we choose to. Note also that the taxonname is in the field variablename. Individual sample counts are reported in Neotoma as variables. A “variable” may be either a species for which we have presence or count data, a geochemical measurement, or any other proxy, such as charcoal counts. Each stored entry for a variable includes the units of measurement and the value.\n\n\n5.4.3.2 Taxonomic Harmonization (Simple)\nA standard challenge in Neotoma (and in biodiversity research more generally) is that different scientists use different names for taxonomic entities such as species. Even if everyone agrees on a common taxonomy, it’s quite possible that a given fossil might be only partially identifiable, perhaps just to genus or even family. Hence, when working with data from Neotoma, a common intermediary step is to ‘harmonize’ all the taxa names stored in Neotoma into some standard names of interest to you.\nLet’s say we want to know the past distribution of Pinus. We want all the various pollen morphotypes that are associated with Pinus (e.g. Pinus strobus, Pinus strobus-type, Pinus undif., Pinus banksiana/resinosa) to be grouped together into one aggregated taxon names called Pinus. There are several ways of doing this, either directly by exporting the file and editing each individual cell, or by creating an external “harmonization” table.\nProgrammatically, we can harmonize all the taxon names using matching and transformation. We’re using dplyr type coding here to mutate() the column variablename so that any time we detect (str_detect()) a variablename that starts with Pinus (the .* represents a wildcard for any character [.], zero or more times [*]) we replace() it with the character string \"Pinus\". Note that this changes Pinus in the allSamp object, but if we were to call samples() again, the taxonomy would return to its original form.\nAs a first step, we’re going to filter the ecological groups to include only UPHE (upleand/heath) and TRSH (trees and shrubs). (More information about ecological groups is available from the Neotoma Online Manual.) After converting all _Pinus._ records to Pinus* we then sum the counts of the Pinus records.\n\nallSamp <- allSamp %>%\n  dplyr::filter(ecologicalgroup %in% c(\"UPHE\", \"TRSH\")) %>%\n  mutate(variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Pinus.*\"),\n                                \"Pinus\"),\n         variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Ambrosia.*\"),\n                                \"Ambrosia\")) %>%\n  group_by(siteid, sitename,\n           sampleid, variablename, units, age,\n           agetype, depth, datasetid,\n           long, lat) %>%\n  summarise(value = sum(value), .groups='keep')\n\nThere were originally 6 different taxa identified as being within the genus Pinus (including Pinus, Pinus subg. Pinus, and Pinus undiff.). The above code reduces them all to a single taxonomic group Pinus. We can check out the unique names by using:\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\nneotomatx %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Pinus\")) %>%\n  reframe(pinus_spp = unique(variablename))\n\n# I actually like Base here for the one-liner:\n# unique(grep(\"Pinus\", neotomatx$variablename, value = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise question 5: Follow the Pinus example above, but now for Picea. How many taxon names were aggregated into your Picea name?\nIf we want to store a record of our choices outside of R, we can use an external table. For example, a table of pairs (what we want changed, and the name we want it replaced with) can be generated, and it can include regular expressions (if we choose):\n\n\n\noriginal\nreplacement\n\n\n\n\nAbies.*\nAbies\n\n\nVaccinium.*\nEricaceae\n\n\nTypha.*\nAquatic\n\n\nNymphaea\nAquatic\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n\nWe can get the list of original names directly from the taxa() call, applied to a sites object, and then export it using write.csv(). We can also do some exploratory plots of the data:\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\ntaxaplots <- taxa(mich_dl)\n# Save the taxon list to file so we can edit it subsequently.\nreadr::write_csv(taxaplots, \"data/mytaxontable.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure. A plot of the number of sites a taxon appears in, against the number of samples a taxon appears in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot is mostly for illustration, but we can see, as a sanity check, that the relationship is as we’d expect."

Palynologists use a particular form of a stratigraphic diagram called a pollen diagram.\nWe can use packages like rioja to do stratigraphic plotting for a single dataset. Here, we’ll take a few key species at a single site and plot them.\n\n# Get a particular site, select only taxa identified from pollen (and only trees/shrubs)\n# Transform to proportion values.\ndevils_samples <- get_sites(siteid = 666) %>%\n  get_downloads() %>%\n  samples()\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>%\n  mutate(variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Pinus.*\"),\n                                \"Pinus\")) %>%\n  group_by(siteid, sitename,\n           sampleid, variablename, units, age,\n           agetype, depth, datasetid,\n           long, lat) %>%\n  summarise(value = sum(value), .groups='keep')\n\n\nonesite <- devils_samples %>%\n  group_by(age) %>%\n  mutate(pollencount = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  group_by(variablename) %>%\n  mutate(prop = value / pollencount) %>%\n  arrange(desc(age))\n\n# Spread the data to a \"wide\" table, with taxa as column headings.\nwidetable <- onesite %>%\n  dplyr::select(age, variablename, prop) %>%\n  mutate(prop = as.numeric(prop))  %>%\n  dplyr::filter(variablename %in% c(\"Pinus\", \"Betula\", \"Quercus\",\n                             \"Tsuga\", \"Ulmus\", \"Picea\"))\n\nprops <- tidyr::pivot_wider(widetable,\n                             id_cols = age,\n                             names_from = variablename,\n                             values_from = prop,\n                             values_fill = 0)\n\nThis appears to be a fairly long set of commands, but the code is pretty straightforward, and it provides you with significant control over the taxa for display, units pf measurement, and other elements of your data before you get them into the wide matrix (depth by taxon) that most statistical tools such as the vegan package or rioja use. To plot we can use rioja’s strat.plot(), sorting the taxa using weighted averaging scores (wa.order). We’ve also added a CONISS plot to the edge of the plot, to show how the new wide data frame works with distance metric functions. (We’ll talk more about distance and dissimilarity metrics in upcoming labs.)\n\nclust <- rioja::chclust(dist(sqrt(props)),\n                        method = \"coniss\")\n\nplot <- rioja::strat.plot(props[,-1] * 100, yvar = props$age,\n                  title = devils_samples$sitename[1],\n                  ylabel = \"Calibrated Years BP\",\n                  #xlabel = \"Pollen (%)\",\n                  y.rev = TRUE,\n                  clust = clust,\n                  wa.order = \"topleft\", scale.percent = TRUE)\n\nrioja::addClustZone(plot, clust, 4, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nExercise question 6: Make a stratigraphic pollen diagram in rioja, for a site of your choice (not Devils Lake) and taxa of your choice. Show code and resulting diagram.\n\n\n5.5.2 Change Taxon Distributions Across Space and Time\nThe true power of Neotoma is its ability to support large-scale analyses across many sites, many s time periods within sites, many proxies, and many taxa. As a first dipping of our toes in the water, lets look at temporal trends in abundance when averaged across ites. We now have site information across Michigan, with samples, and with taxon names. Let’s say we are interested in looking at the distributions of the selected taxa across time, their presence/absence:\n\ntaxabyage <- allSamp %>%\n  dplyr:::filter(variablename %in% c(\"Pinus\", \"Betula\", \"Quercus\",\n                             \"Tsuga\", \"Ulmus\", \"Picea\"),\n                             age < 11000) %>%\n  group_by(variablename, \"age\" = round(age * 2, -3) / 2) %>%\n  summarise(n = length(unique(siteid)), .groups = 'keep')\n\nsamplesbyage <- allSamp %>%\n  dplyr::filter(variablename %in% c(\"Pinus\", \"Betula\", \"Quercus\",\n                             \"Tsuga\", \"Ulmus\", \"Picea\")) %>%\n  group_by(\"age\" = round(age * 2, -3) / 2) %>%\n  summarise(samples = length(unique(siteid)), .groups = 'keep')\n\ngroupbyage <- taxabyage %>%\n  inner_join(samplesbyage, by = \"age\") %>%\n  mutate(proportion = n / samples)\n\nggplot(groupbyage, aes(x = age, y = proportion)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'gam',\n              method.args = list(family = 'binomial')) +\n  facet_wrap(~variablename) +\n  #coord_cartesian(xlim = c(22500, 0), ylim = c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  xlab(\"Proportion of Sites with Taxon\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nWe can see clear patterns of change for at least some taxa, and the smoothed surfaces are modeled using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) in R, so we can have more or less control over the actual modeling using the gam or mgcv packages. Depending on how we divide the data we can also look at shifts in altitude, latitude or longitude to better understand how species distributions and abundances changed over time in this region.\nNote that for some taxa, they always have a few pollen grains in all pollen samples, so this ‘proportion of sites with taxon’ isn’t very informative. Calculating a metric like average abundance might be more useful.\nExercise question 7: Repeat the above example, for a different state or other geographic region of your choice."

We have provided this dataset as an .rds file in the data directory, it is preferable to read the dataset avoid repeated API calls. the following code is included so that you can manipulate the inputs (e.g., sideid = and harmonising taxa) and object name to download and experiment with different datasets.\n\n# The following code can be done in one pipeline but we have split it into chunks to help with readablity\ndevils_samples <- get_sites(siteid = 666) %>% # Download the site samples data\n  get_downloads() %>%\n  samples()\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>%+\n  dplyr::filter(ecologicalgroup %in% c(\"UPHE\", \"TRSH\"), # Filter ecological groups by upland heath and trees and shrubs\n         elementtype == \"pollen\", # filter bu pollen samples\n         units == \"NISP\") %>% # Filter by sampling unit\n  mutate(variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Pinus.*\"), # Harmonize Pinus into one group\n                                \"Pinus\")) %>%\n  group_by(siteid, sitename,\n           sampleid, variablename, units, age,\n           agetype, depth, datasetid,\n           long, lat) %>%\n  summarise(value = sum(value), .groups='keep') # The group_by function will drop columns not used as grouping variables\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>% # Calculate proportions of each species by year group\n  group_by(age) %>%\n  mutate(pollencount = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  group_by(variablename) %>%\n  mutate(prop = value / pollencount) %>%\n  arrange(desc(age)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\nsaveRDS(devils_samples, \"./data/devils_samples.rds\") # Save the data for later\n\nThe following code reads-in the Devil’s Lake data provided in the data directory. Sometimes minor mistakes along the way lead to errors, so you can always come back here and read in the formatted data again.\n\n# Load up the data\ndevils_samples <- readRDS(\"./data/devils_samples.rds\")\n\n\n\nThe data are in long format as a tibble, i.e., similar to a dataframe. This format can be great for data wrangling and plotting; however, many analyses require a specific input such as a (wide) site-by-species matrix. It is important to be comfotable with pivoting data between long and wide formats and converting between dataframes/tibbles and matrices. Remember, that unlike dataframes and tibbles, matrices cannot be of mixed type (e.g., strings and numbers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh no! Common sources of error (and anxiety…) 😱\n\n\n\nIf a numeric matrix is required as the input make sure the data haven’t been converted to strings. R will coerce numbers to characters if there is a character (like a nameing column) in the matrix. This coersion can go unnoticed when converting from a dataframe to a matrix.\n\nstring_matrix <- matrix(c(\"1\", 2:10), nrow = 2) # see the numbers are in quotes indicating a string? \nstr(string_matrix) # Check the structure\n\n chr [1:2, 1:5] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\" \"7\" \"8\" \"9\" \"10\"\n\n\nNumeric matrix:\n\nnumeric_matrix <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2) # see the numbers are in quotes indicating a string? \nstr(numeric_matrix) # Check the structure\n\n int [1:2, 1:5] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n\nMatrices can have names (e.g., species names) as column names and maintain a numeric structure, for example: colnames(numeric_matrix) <- LETTERS[1:5].\n\n\nThe analogue package calculates several distance metrics on site-by-species matrices. So let’s pivot our data to wide format and convert it to a matrix. This can be done in several ways in R, for consistency’s sake we’ll use tidyr:\n\ndevils_samples_wide <- devils_samples %>%\n    tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = c(age, depth),\n                       names_from = variablename,\n                       values_from = prop,\n                       values_fill = 0) %>%\n    as.matrix()\n\ndevils_ad <- devils_samples_wide[ , c(1:2)] # store the ages and depths separately\n\ndevils_samples_wide <- devils_samples_wide[ , -c(1:2)] # drop ages and depth as they are not included in the distance calculations\ndevils_names <- colnames(devils_samples_wide)\n\nmmm can I fill NAs with 0s using SQchord?\n\nCodeResult\n\n\n\ndevils_sqdist <- analogue::distance(devils_samples_wide, method = \"SQchord\")"

    "text": "9.1 Part 1: Background\nThe modern analog technique (MAT) is a standard approach for making quantitative inferences about past vegetation and climate from fossil pollen data – and from many other forms of paleoecological data (Chevalier et al. 2020; J. W. Williams and Shuman 2008; Gavin et al. 2003; Overpeck, Webb, and Prentice 1985). The MAT relies on reasoning by analogy (Jackson and Williams 2004), in which it is assumed that two compositionally similar pollen assemblages were produced by similar plant communities, growing under similar environments. The similarity of pollen assemblages is determined by the calculation of dissimilarity metrics.\nThe MAT can also be thought of as a non-parametric statistical technique, that computer scientists call a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. It is a simple form of machine learning. Each fossil pollen assemblage is matched to 1 or more (\\(k\\)) modern pollen assemblages, then is assigned the ecological and environmental characteristics associated with those modern analogues.\nThe MAT is a popular approach for reconstructing past environments and climates, due to its relative simplicity and intuitive appeal. However, like any algorithm, if used unwisely, it can produce spurious results. More generally, when reasoning by analogy, be careful! Analogies are always incomplete and imperfect, and you must use your critical judgment to determine whether these imperfections are minor or serious.\nTo reconstruct past environments using the MAT, we need three data sets:\n\nmodern species assemblages\nmodern environmental variables\nfossil species assemblages\n\nThe MAT follows four basic steps:\n\nCalculate dissimilarities between a fossil species assemblage i and all modern species assemblages in set \\(S\\).\nDiscard modern samples with dissimilarities greater than a threshold Dthreshold.\nIdentify and retain the k closest modern analogs.\nAverage the environmental conditions associated with the modern analogs and assign them to fossil sample \\(i\\).\n\nNote that we are taking a detour into paleoclimatology for two reasons. First, because paleoclimatic reconstructions are still a primary use for fossil pollen and other micropaleontological data. Second, because the MAT and the analogue package, as a dissimilarity-based approach, also lets us explore the novelty of past communities - perhaps of more interest to paleoecologists than inferred paleoclimates!"

    "section": "9.2 Part 2: Cross-Validation",
    "text": "9.2 Part 2: Cross-Validation\nBefore reconstructing environmental variables from fossil pollen assemblages, we usually assess how MAT performs in the modern species assemblage. This step is usually referred to as calibration or cross-validation.\nIn cross-validation, a calibration function is trained on one portion of the modern species assemblages (calibration set) and applied to another portion of the modern species assemblages (validation set). These two datasets are thus mutually exclusive and - possibly - independent. To cross-validate MAT, we usually use a technique called k-fold cross-validation. In \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation the modern data set is split into k mutually exclusive subsets. For each kth subset, the calibration dataset comprises all the samples not in \\(k\\), while the samples in \\(k\\) comprise the validation dataset. The simplest form of \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation is the leave-one-out (LOO) technique, in which just a single sample is removed and then all other samples are used to build a prediction for that sample. This procedure is then repeated for all samples. The analogue package uses leave-one-out cross-validation.\nStandard metrics include RMSE and R^2. Here, we’ll use the cross-validation tools built into the analogue package.\nNote that the palaeoSig package, developed by Richard Telford, has additional functions that can test for significance relative to randomly generated variables with the same spatial structure as the environmental variable of interest. We won’t use this package in this lab, but it’s useful for testing whether apparently strong cross-validation results are merely an artifact of spatial autocorrelation (Telford and Birks 2005).\nWe will use the North American Modern Pollen Dataset (Whitmore et al. 2005) for this cross-validation analysis. Note that the NAMPD is pre-loaded into the analogue package, but here we’ll use use the original (more complete) data so that we can filter locations easily.\nLet’s get the data ready:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages required for this section\n\n\n\nList of packages required for section and what they are used for\n\n# Load up the package\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\")\npacman::p_load(neotoma2, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, neotoma2, analogue, vegan, readxl, fuzzyjoin)\n\n\n\nThe following code (unfold by clicking the dropdown) downloads the data from the neotoma API and formats it to long data. More easily, you can read in the .rds file in the data directory.\n\n\nCode\n# The following code can be done in one pipeline but we have split it into chunks to help with readablity\ndevils_samples <- get_sites(siteid = 666) %>% # Download the site samples data\n  get_downloads() %>%\n  samples()\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>%\n  dplyr::filter(ecologicalgroup %in% c(\"UPHE\", \"TRSH\"), # Filter ecological groups by upland heath and trees and shrubs\n                elementtype == \"pollen\", # filter bu pollen samples\n                units == \"NISP\") %>% # Filter by sampling unit\n         mutate(variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Pinus.*\"), # Harmonize Pinus into one group\n                                \"Pinus\"),\n                variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Ambrosia.*\"),\n                                \"Ambrosia\")) %>%\n  group_by(siteid, sitename,\n           sampleid, variablename, units, age,\n           agetype, depth, datasetid,\n           long, lat) %>%\n  summarise(value = sum(value), .groups='keep') # The group_by function will drop columns not used as grouping variables\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>% # Calculate proportions of each species by year group\n  group_by(age) %>%\n  mutate(pollencount = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  group_by(variablename) %>%\n  mutate(prop = value / pollencount) %>%\n  arrange(desc(age)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\nsaveRDS(devils_samples, \"./data/devils_samples.rds\") # Save the data for later\n\n\nTo read in the example data use:\n\n# Load up the data\ndevils_samples <- readRDS(\"./data/devils_samples.rds\")\n\nWe will use the North American Modern Pollen Database (NAMPD) to create modern analogues. The NAMPD is not (yet) accessible through neotoma but is stored on servers at the University of Madison WI. JACK ACTION POINT: to use this method in other regions what databases are available. The following code downloads the NAMPD from the server to your data directory, unzips the downloaded data, and reads in the relevant datasheets from the excel file. If you do not already have a directory named data from previous chapters CROSSREF INTRO set-up instructions one will be created.\n\ndir.create(\"./data\") # If the data directory exists it will not be overwritten\ndownload.file(\"https://williamspaleolab.github.io/data/whitmoreetal2005.zip\", \"./data/whitmoreetal2005.zip\")\nunzip(\"./data/whitmoreetal2005.zip\", exdir = \"./data/whitmoreetal2005\")\nmod_pol <- read_excel(\"./data/whitmoreetal2005/whitmoreetal2005_v1-72.xls\", sheet = \"POLLEN DATA\")\nmod_clim <- read_excel(\"./data/whitmoreetal2005/whitmoreetal2005_v1-72.xls\", sheet = \"CLIMATE+BIOCLIMATE\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh no! 😱\n\n\n\nIf you do not already have a directory named data from previous chapters CROSSREF INTRO set-up instructions one will be created. If the directory already exists you will see a warning message:\nWarning message:\nIn dir.create(\"./data\") : '.\\data' already exists\nDon’t worry, the function dir.create() will not overwrite any existing directory contents. ./ and . between mac/pc/linux\n\n\nStill with me? Great! Now we have our three datasets: (i) our site of interest (Devil’s Lake palaeo data); (ii) our modern pollen data; and (iii) our modern climate measurements. The modern datasets include the whole of North America and need to be filtered for the Eastern US so that the taxa are relevant to the those in Devil’s Lake. We’re first going to filter by longitude, then select by taxa so that we have a matching matrix of species between Devil’s Lake and the NAMPD.\n\n# several columns contain data not used for the MAT\nmod_pol_east <- mod_pol %>% \n  filter(LONDD >= -105) %>% # Filter for sites east of -105 degrees\n  select(ID2, 14:147) # Select colums with ID and species only\n\n# Many functions require site-by-species matrices in wide format\n# Note we pivoted by age so we have an age column not used in MAT\ndevils_wide <- devils_samples %>% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = age, names_from = variablename, values_from = prop) %>% \n  replace(is.na(.), 0)\n\n# Store ages separately for plotting later:\ndevils_ages <- devils_wide$age\n\nRight, now is the tricky part of matching species names. Unfortunately, the species names between data downloaded from Neotoma and the NAMPD do not match exactly. Sometimes matching is easiest done manually but because of the number of species in both datasets we will do as much as possible programatically. The fuzzyjoin package allows us to match strings (names) by a distance measure and outputs a number of possible matches.\n\nString matching codeLet’s take a closer lookEven closer!\n\n\nlooks like it’s done a good job for the most part! Butthere are a few mismatches.\n\n# Save the names of each dataset\nmod_pol_names <- as_tibble(tolower(colnames(mod_pol_east[-1])))\ndevil_names <- as_tibble(tolower(colnames(devils_wide[-1])))\n\n# match the names using fuzzy matching\nnames_matches <- stringdist_left_join(devil_names, mod_pol_names, by = \"value\",\n                                      max_dist = 4, distance_col = \"distance\", method = \"jw\") %>% \n                   group_by(value.x) %>%\n                   slice_min(order_by = distance, n = 1)\n\nhead(names_matches, 15) \n\n# A tibble: 15 × 3\n# Groups:   value.x [15]\n   value.x                      value.y    distance\n   <chr>                        <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 abies                        abies        0     \n 2 acer                         acerx        0.0667\n 3 alnus                        alnusx       0.0556\n 4 amaranthaceae undiff.        rhamnaceae   0.308 \n 5 ambrosia                     ambrosia     0     \n 6 amorpha-type                 amorpha      0.139 \n 7 angiospermae undiff.

We can select those species from the NAMPD:\n\n# Select species based on name\nmod_pol_east_match <- mod_pol_east %>%\n  rename_with(tolower) %>% \n  select(c(id2, names_matches_filter$value.y))\n\n# the analoge functions need species names to match\n# so lets name everything in our filtered modern pollen the same as in Devil's Lake\nnew_names <- c(names_matches_filter$value.y)\nnames(new_names) <- c(names_matches_filter$value.x)\n\nmod_pol_east_match <- mod_pol_east_match %>% \n  rename(all_of(new_names))\n\n# recall that the Devil's Lake data are in relative proportions\n# let's create a matrix of species only for the MAT with relative proportions\n# This is an approach for calculating relative abundances on wide data:\nmod_pol_east_match_prop <- mod_pol_east_match[-1] / rowSums(mod_pol_east_match[-1])*1\n\n# while we are here lets make a matrix of species only from Devils Lake\ndevils_prop <- devils_wide %>% \n  rename_with(tolower) %>% \n  select(names_matches_filter$value.x) %>% \n  as.matrix()\n\nThe last bit of wrangling we need to do is filter the climate data to match the pollen data. This part is easy because both climate and pollen are from the same data-source and have associated IDs.\n\nmod_clim_filter <- mod_clim %>% \n  filter(ID2 %in% mod_pol_east_match$id2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood practice tip\n\n\n\nWhenever filtering or joining data it is good to check the dimensions before and after by using dim() to see if the results are what you expect. Some functions will run correctly but produce unexpected results.\n\n\nThat took some pretty advanced wrangling to get the data in order. Such is often the case when using multiple sources of data. As always, there are many ways to achieve the same result. You can use these data wrangling tricks on different datasets and save a lot of time doing manual work.\nNow let’s do the analysis!

(GDD5 is growing degree days and is a measure of growing season length and strength; MIPT is an index of soil moisture availability).\nWhich variable has the best cross-validation statistics?\n\nWhich has the worst?\n\nGiven what you know about the climatic controls on plant distributions (and/or our ability to precisely quantify these variables), is the relative predictive skill for these different climatic variables surprising or unsurprising? Why?\nCheck the Devil’s Lake novelty curve against the pollen diagram for Devil’s Lake. What combinations of pollen taxa produce these no-analog assemblages?\nAccording to Webb(1986), what are two general hypotheses for why we might have these past mixtures of species with no modern analogue?\nWhy should one be dubious about the temperature reconstructions at Devil’s Lake for the high-novelty assemblages?\nEven for the low-novelty assemblages, name two potentially important sources of uncertainty in MAT-based reconstructions of past climate from fossil pollen data.\n\nConversely, based on our knowledge about the geographic climatic distributions of these taxa, why might one argue that these January temperature reconstructions are plausible?\n\nTo get practice, make reconstructions of GDD5 and mean July precipitation. Show plots of your work.\n\n\n\n\n\nChevalier, Manuel, Basil A. S. Davis, Oliver Heiri, Heikki Seppä, Brian M.

    "text": "9.2 Part 2: analysis\n\n9.2.1 Data wrangling\nIn this case, data are coming from two separate sources, NeotomaDB and the North American Modern Pollen Dataset (NAMPD). We will use the NAMPD (Whitmore et al. 2005) for the cross-validation analysis. Note that the NAMPD is pre-loaded into the analogue package, but here we’ll use use the original (more complete) data so that we can filter locations easily. Some of the data wrangling required to get two matrices containing the same species with identical names for the correct region (as required by the MAT function) is fairly advanced. This type of wrangling is quite common in palaeoecological data-science as you may be dealing with, for example, raw data collected by individuals stored in inconsistent formats. However; if you prefer to skip all the wrangling and jump directly to the anayses in Section 9.2.2, the data have been saved post-wrangling and can be loaded into R directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump point\n\n\n\nRun this code (unfold the code chunk below) to load in the pre-wranged data and portal to Section 9.2.2\n\n\nCode\nfile_names <- c(\"./data/mod_pol_east_match_prop.rds\", \"./data/mod_clim_filter.rds\", \"./data/devils_prop.rds\", \"./data/devils_ages.rds\")\nobj_names <- c(\"mod_pol_east_match_prop\", \"mod_clim_filter\", \"devils_prop\", \"devils_ages\")\nrds_list <- lapply(file_names, readRDS)\nnames(rds_list) <- obj_names\nlist2env(rds_list, globalenv())\n\n\n\n\nReady to Wrange? Let’s get the data ready:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages required for this section\n\n\n\n\n# Load up the packages\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\")\npacman::p_load(neotoma2, tidyverse, neotoma2, analogue, vegan, readxl, fuzzyjoin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespawn point\n\n\n\nThe following code (unfold by clicking the dropdown) downloads the data from the neotoma API and formats it with basic harmonisation and pollen proportions calculated. This part of the data wrangling is covered in detail in Chapter 5 so, more easily, you can read in the pre-wrangled .rds file in the data directory. Note that this is the long format data not the species only matrix from the jump point above.\n\n\nCode\n# The following code can be done in one pipeline but we have split it into chunks to help with readablity\ndevils_samples <- get_sites(siteid = 666) %>% # Download the site samples data\n  get_downloads() %>%\n  samples()\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>%\n  dplyr::filter(ecologicalgroup %in% c(\"UPHE\", \"TRSH\"), # Filter ecological groups by upland heath and trees and shrubs\n                elementtype == \"pollen\", # filter bu pollen samples\n                units == \"NISP\") %>% # Filter by sampling unit\n         mutate(variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Pinus.*\"), # Harmonize Pinus into one group\n                                \"Pinus\"),\n                variablename = replace(variablename,\n                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, \"Ambrosia.*\"),\n                                \"Ambrosia\")) %>%\n  group_by(siteid, sitename,\n           sampleid, variablename, units, age,\n           agetype, depth, datasetid,\n           long, lat) %>%\n  summarise(value = sum(value), .groups='keep') # The group_by function will drop columns not used as grouping variables\n\ndevils_samples <- devils_samples %>% # Calculate proportions of each species by year group\n  group_by(age) %>%\n  mutate(pollencount = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  group_by(variablename) %>%\n  mutate(prop = value / pollencount) %>%\n  arrange(desc(age)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# saveRDS(devils_samples, \"./data/devils_samples.rds\") # Save the data for later\n\n\n\n\nTo read in the pre-wrangled long data for Devil’s Lake use:\n\n# Load up the data\ndevils_samples <- readRDS(\"./data/devils_samples.rds\")\n\nWe will use the North American Modern Pollen Database (NAMPD) to create modern analogues. The NAMPD is not (yet) accessible through neotoma but is stored on servers at the University of Madison WI. JACK ACTION POINT: to use this method in other regions what databases are available. The following code downloads the NAMPD from the server to your data directory, unzips the downloaded data, and reads in the relevant datasheets from the excel file.\n\ndownload.file(\"https://williamspaleolab.github.io/data/whitmoreetal2005.zip\", \"./data/whitmoreetal2005.zip\")\nunzip(\"./data/whitmoreetal2005.zip\", exdir = \"./data/whitmoreetal2005\")\nmod_pol <- read_excel(\"./data/whitmoreetal2005/whitmoreetal2005_v1-72.xls\", sheet = \"POLLEN DATA\")\nmod_clim <- read_excel(\"./data/whitmoreetal2005/whitmoreetal2005_v1-72.xls\", sheet = \"CLIMATE+BIOCLIMATE\")\n\nStill with me? Great! Now we have our three datasets: (i) our site of interest (Devil’s Lake palaeo data); (ii) our modern pollen data; and (iii) our modern climate measurements. The modern datasets include the whole of North America and need to be filtered for the Eastern US so that the taxa are relevant to the those in Devil’s Lake. We’re first going to filter by longitude, then select by taxa so that we have a matching matrix of species between Devil’s Lake and the NAMPD. We are going to keep all data West of 105°W, see Krause et al. (2019) and John W. Williams, Shuman, and Webb III (2001).\n\n# several columns contain data not used for the MAT\nmod_pol_east <- mod_pol %>% \n  filter(LONDD >= -105) %>% # Filter for sites east of -105 degrees\n  select(ID2, 14:147) # Select colums with ID and species only\n\n# Many functions require site-by-species matrices in wide format\n# Note we pivoted by age so we have an age column not used in MAT\ndevils_wide <- devils_samples %>% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = age, names_from = variablename, values_from = prop) %>% \n  replace(is.na(.), 0)\n\n# Store ages separately for plotting later:\ndevils_ages <- devils_wide$age\n\nRight, now is the tricky part of matching species names. Unfortunately, the species names between data downloaded from Neotoma and the NAMPD do not match exactly. Sometimes matching is easiest done manually but because of the number of species in both datasets we will do as much as possible programatically. The fuzzyjoin package allows us to match strings (names) by a distance measure and outputs a number of possible matches.\n\nString matching codeLet’s take a closer lookEven closer!\n\n\nlooks like it’s done a good job for the most part! Butthere are a few mismatches.\n\n# Save the names of each dataset and convert all to lowercase\nmod_pol_names <- as_tibble(tolower(colnames(mod_pol_east[-1])))\ndevil_names <- as_tibble(tolower(colnames(devils_wide[-1])))\n\n# match the names using fuzzy matching\nnames_matches <- stringdist_left_join(devil_names, mod_pol_names, by = \"value\",\n                                      max_dist = 4, distance_col = \"distance\", method = \"jw\") %>% \n                   group_by(value.x) %>%\n                   slice_min(order_by = distance, n = 1) # change the value of n to see more potential matches\n\nhead(names_matches, 15) \n\n# A tibble: 15 × 3\n# Groups:   value.x [15]\n   value.x                      value.y    distance\n   <chr>                        <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 abies                        abies        0     \n 2 acer                         acerx        0.0667\n 3 alnus                        alnusx       0.0556\n 4 amaranthaceae undiff.        rhamnaceae   0.308 \n 5 ambrosia                     ambrosia     0     \n 6 amorpha-type                 amorpha      0.139 \n 7 angiospermae undiff.

We can select those species from the NAMPD:\n\n# Select species based on name\nmod_pol_east_match <- mod_pol_east %>%\n  rename_with(tolower) %>% # convert to lowercase for matching\n  select(c(id2, names_matches_filter$value.y)) # keep id column and select species\n\n# The analoge functions need species names to match between datasets\n# so lets name everything in our filtered modern pollen the same as in Devil's Lake\nmod_pol_east_match <- mod_pol_east_match %>% \n  rename(all_of(deframe(names_matches_filter[ ,1:2])))\n\n# recall that the Devil's Lake data are in relative proportions\n# let's create a matrix of only species for the MAT with relative proportions\n# This is an approach for calculating relative abundances on wide data:\nmod_pol_east_match_prop <- as.matrix(mod_pol_east_match[-1] / rowSums(mod_pol_east_match[-1])*1)\n\n# while we are here let's make a matrix of species only from Devils Lake\ndevils_prop <- devils_wide %>% \n  rename_with(tolower) %>% \n  select(names_matches_filter$value.x) %>% # Remember we removed a few species without matches?\n  as.matrix()\n\nThe last bit of wrangling we need to do is filter the climate data to match the modern pollen data. This part is easy because both climate and pollen are from the same data-source and have associated IDs.\n\nmod_clim_filter <- mod_clim %>% \n  filter(ID2 %in% mod_pol_east_match$id2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood practice tip\n\n\n\nWhenever filtering or joining data it is good to check the dimensions before and after by using dim() to see if the results are what you expect. Some functions like left_join() or full_join() may run correctly but produce unexpected results.\n\n\nThat took some pretty advanced wrangling to get the data in order. Such is often the case when using multiple sources of data. As always, there are many ways to achieve the same result. You can use these data wrangling tricks on different datasets and save a lot of time doing manual work.\n\n\n9.2.2 Cross-validation\nBefore reconstructing environmental variables from fossil pollen assemblages, we usually assess how MAT performs in the modern species assemblage. This step is usually referred to as calibration or cross-validation.\nIn cross-validation, a calibration function is trained on one portion of the modern species assemblages (calibration set) and applied to another portion of the modern species assemblages (validation set). These two datasets are thus mutually exclusive and - possibly - independent. To cross-validate MAT, we usually use a technique called \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation. In \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation the modern data set is split into \\(k\\) mutually exclusive subsets. For each \\(k^{th}\\) subset, the calibration dataset comprises all the samples not in \\(k\\), while the samples in \\(k\\) comprise the validation dataset. The simplest form of \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation is the leave-one-out (LOO) technique, in which just a single sample is removed and then all other samples are used to build a prediction for that sample. This procedure is then repeated for all samples. The analogue package uses leave-one-out cross-validation.\nStandard metrics include RMSE and \\(R^2\\). Here, we’ll use the cross-validation tools built into the analogue package.\nNote that the palaeoSig package, developed by Richard Telford, has additional functions that can test for significance relative to randomly generated variables with the same spatial structure as the environmental variable of interest. We won’t use this package in this lab, but it’s useful for testing whether apparently strong cross-validation results are merely an artifact of spatial autocorrelation (Telford and Birks 2005).\nNow let’s do the analysis! First is the cross validation of the modern datasets. Using the modern data, we’ll build a calibration dataset and run cross-validation analyses of the calibration dataset. If you portaled here from the Data Wrangling section, make sure you load in the pre-formatted data from Section 9.2.1.\n\nCodeSummaryPlots\n\n\n\nmod_jant <- data.matrix(mod_clim_filter$tjan)\n\nmodpoll_jant <- analogue::mat(mod_pol_east_match_prop, mod_jant, method=\"SQchord\")\n\n\n\n\nprint(modpoll_jant)\n\n\n    Modern Analogue Technique\n\nCall:\nmat(x = mod_pol_east_match_prop, y = mod_jant, method = \"SQchord\") \n\nPercentiles of the dissimilarities for the training set:\n\n   1%    2%    5%   10%   20% \n0.151 0.196 0.280 0.374 0.515 \n\nInferences based on the mean of k-closest analogues:\n\n  k  RMSEP     R2 Avg Bias Max Bias\n  1  3.607  0.889   -0.178    2.654\n  2  3.311  0.905   -0.242    3.175\n  3  3.232  0.908   -0.245    3.324\n  4  3.165  0.912   -0.245    3.422\n  5  3.131  0.914   -0.265    3.579\n  6  3.126  0.914   -0.274    3.811\n  7  3.148  0.913   -0.276    4.246\n  8  3.202  0.910   -0.287    4.285\n  9  3.244  0.907   -0.302    4.423\n 10  3.279  0.906   -0.320    4.556\n\nInferences based on the weighted mean of k-closest analogues:\n\n  k RMSEP   R2 Avg Bias Max Bias\n  1   NaN   NA      NaN     2.65\n  2   NaN   NA      NaN     2.97\n  3   NaN   NA      NaN     3.14\n  4   NaN   NA      NaN     3.29\n  5   NaN   NA      NaN     3.43\n  6   NaN   NA      NaN     3.59\n  7   NaN   NA      NaN     3.90\n  8   NaN   NA      NaN     3.92\n  9   NaN   NA      NaN     4.01\n 10   NaN   NA      NaN     4.13\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\nplot(modpoll_jant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo interpret the results review Simpson (2007), Section 2.1.\n\n\n9.2.3 Novelty and Paleoclimatic Reconstruction\nJack action point Section needs some info from the lecture content to help understand the process as a stand-alone unit.\nFor this part of the lab, we’ll first assess the novelty of the fossil pollen assemblages at Devil’s Lake.
