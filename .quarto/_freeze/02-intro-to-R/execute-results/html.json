We include detailed comments in the code, but do not attempt to provide a complete introduction to R. We include pointers to exceptional resources for learning R basics should you need them:\n\nFree books by [Roger Peng](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?category=r&type=book&search=peng) and [Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\n\n- **(Telford biostats, environmental computing)**\n\n## R GUI\n\nRStudio and VS Code\n\n## R projects\n\nR projects are not essential to use but can make life a little easier\n\n## Directory structure\n\nHaving a well structured project directory is important for accessing the files you need and for reproducibility.\n\n## Version control\n\nIt is good practice to back-up your data and use version control for your code. Onve you integrate version control into your workflow you will wonder how you ever lived without it. Version control is a vast subject but knowing the basics can get you a very far. The Git language (not to be confused with GitHub the remote server) is a common method used to colaborate in software development. Git is not a pre-requisite for this book but as a necessary part of an advanced workflow we include some links to learning basic version control:\n\n- links...\n\nAs an example, this book itself is version controlled and collaborated on using Git and GitHub, the resources can be found **here-LINK**\n\n\n## Packages\n\nR is equiped with packages for data wrangling aside from the `BASE` R language, notably `data.table` and several packages inside the `tidyverse` library. We won't debate the differences here. We will primarily use packages from the `tidyverse` (`dplyr, ggplot2...) because they integrate with the `neotoma2` package used for interacting with the Neotoma(link) API.\n\n\n## Packages used in this book\n\nThe following packages are required for this book. Run the following code to install them all (installation might take a few minutes!).\n\n**more to come, mgcv, pca packages.....**\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='02-intro-to-R_cache/html/book-packages_bd791f9207851a5f02069272d8efbd13'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\")\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, neotoma2, Bchron)    # Install & load packages\n```\n:::",
