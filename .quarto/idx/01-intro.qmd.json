Neotoma DB is an open and community-curated resource for paleoecological data.  Open means that anyone can find and download data from Neotoma.  Community-curated means that Neotoma data are augmented and maintained by a community of experts, with many scientists contributing their data to Neotoma and actively working to curate and improve these data.  Explorer is a graphical interface that is very handy for a first-pass search, discovery, and viewing of paleoecological data, typically exploring a few sites at a time.  In following weeks, we will move to more advanced visualizations and analyses of paleoecological data, using software designed to download data from Neotoma and analyze it."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"01-intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","bibliography":["data-driven-curriculum.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
