We include detailed comments in the code, but do not attempt to provide a complete introduction to R. We include pointers to exceptional resources for learning R basics should you need them:\n\nFree books by [Roger Peng](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?category=r&type=book&search=peng) and [Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\n\n- **(Telford biostats, environmental computing)**\n\n## R GUI\n\nRStudio and VS Code\n\n## R projects\n\nR projects are not essential to use but can make life a little easier\n\n## Directory structure\n\nHaving a well structured project directory is important for accessing the files you need and for reproducibility.\n\n## Version control\n\nIt is good practice to back-up your data and use version control for your code. Onve you integrate version control into your workflow you will wonder how you ever lived without it. Version control is a vast subject but knowing the basics can get you a very far. The Git language (not to be confused with GitHub the remote server) is a common method used to colaborate in software development. Git is not a pre-requisite for this book but as a necessary part of an advanced workflow we include some links to learning basic version control:\n\n- links...\n\nAs an example, this book itself is version controlled and collaborated on using Git and GitHub, the resources can be found **here-LINK**\n\n\n## Packages\n\nR is equiped with packages for data wrangling aside from the `BASE` R language, notably `data.table` and several packages inside the `tidyverse` library. We won't debate the differences here. We will primarily use packages from the `tidyverse` (`dplyr, ggplot2...) because they integrate with the `neotoma2` package used for interacting with the Neotoma(link) API.\n\n\n## Packages used in this book\n\nThe following packages are required for this book. Run the following code to install them all (installation might take a few minutes!).\n\n**more to come, mgcv, pca packages.....**\n\n```{r book-packages}\n#| output: false\n#| warning: false\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\", repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\")\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, neotoma2, Bchron, devtools)    # Install & load packages\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"02-intro-to-R.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","bibliography":["data-driven-curriculum.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
